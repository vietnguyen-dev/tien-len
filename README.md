Tien Len is a Vietnamese Gambling game played with poker cards.

4 player start with 13 cards and whoever gets rid of all their cards first wins!

Once I learn WebRTC I will implement it but that may take some time.
This version currently uses React, Redux and the Deck of Cards API

I wanted to build this app to learn Redux in the context outside of Ecommerce, which I have been doing a lot of.
